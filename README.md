This was our first assignment in CS 4050. We were given a Java Program with a GUI, and we implemented different sorting methods that we were assigned. Carson created the ShellSort and InsertionSort implementations. Drew created the QuickSort and SelectionSort implementations. Connor created the Recursive MergeSort and BubbleSort implementations. We also created the buttons for each sorting algorithm and recorded the time of each sorting algorithm, which is displayed on the GUI after the corresponding button is clicked, and data is sorted. There is also an implementation for Iterative MergeSort, and that was given to us by Prof. Ouda.
